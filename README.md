dice game (html, css, javascript)

Hi folks,

this is a simple dice-game with the option to choose the number of players (1-4) and the number of rounds (1-10).
As itÂ´s my first project, there are tons of ugly code, but I just wanted to make the code run :).

Watch the screenshot to see how it looks like.

Have fun!
